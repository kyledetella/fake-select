Faux Select
===========

Easily create and manage a stylized `<select>` list.

## Setup

```
npm i
```

## Development

npm run watch
```

This will spin up a web server on the default port of `8000`. To change the port, simply set the `PORT` env variable before running the script.

## Tests

To run the tests once:

```
npm t
```

To run the tests continuously:

```
npm run test-watch
```
